## What did I learn?
I learn to use wireframing to draw a rough sketch of how I wanted my webpage to look like. 

## What could I have done better?
I could have used Figma.com to design the UX of the page. I'll learn to use Figma and implement it in my future work.

## What makes my project stand out?
The imperfection of my project is what makes it stand out. It's like journaling my journey as a beginner in web development, it contains flaws and mistakes but it also shows how much I've learnt and grown.
